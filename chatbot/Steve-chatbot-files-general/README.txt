Help
You can ask questions to Steve in three different ways: (in this example I will use the question "What is your name")
1.	"What is your name?"
2.	"What is your name"
3.	"what is your name?
4.	"what is your name"
Notice the difference in capitalization and punctuation in the examples above
If Steve is not working properly you can force quit him by pressing ctrl+z or just quitting the application your running him on (for example a terminal)
To normally quit Steve just say "Bye" and Steve will quit
Steve can currently only respond to a few questions which have programmed responses because he does not use artificial intelligence to answer
