## Installation

1. Go to [My Github installation page](https://github.com/rishaank/chatbot/releases) to install chatbot 
2. After you go there if you have a computer which supports the .exe format, download and run the .exe installer and follow the steps on your screen. If your computer doesn't support the .exe format skip to step 3
3.  Expand Assets for the newest version of Steve (the one on the top)  then click on the file with a .c extension
4. Save the file on your desktop
5. \*make sure you have GCC on your terminal for the next step(s)*
6. Open your terminal (also known as command prompt on Windows)
7. Type the command _cd Desktop_ or if you get an error message type _cd desktop_ to change directories to your desktop
8. Type _gcc chatbot.c_  to compile the C program
9. Type _clear_ or _cls_ to clear the screen
10. Type _./a.out_ or *a.exe* to run the program

## Help

You can ask questions to Steve in three different ways: (in this example I will use the question "What is your name")

1. "What is your name?"
2. "What is your name"
3. "what is your name?
4. "what is your name"

Notice the difference in capitalization and punctuation in the examples above

If Steve is not working properly you can force quit him by pressing ctrl+z or just quitting the application your running him  on (for example a terminal)

To normally quit Steve just say "Bye" and Steve will quit

Steve can currently only respond to a few questions which have programmed responses because he does not use artificial intelligence to answer
